# flask-cost-analysis-systerm
High-way project's cost analysis systerm baseed on flask framework.
I am a  cost engineer of CCCC First Harbor Engineering Company Ltd.This job need me to collect and analyse the data(mostly about income and cost) in highway project.Most of cost engineer use excel to do this job.Using excel only makes data in sepretaed workbook,can't orgnize data efficiently,cause many problems:such as hard to keep change synchronized(between diffrent workbooks,diffrent computers),too much data redundancy,complex relationship between workbooks.
In order to solve the problems above,i learned relational database and some python knowledge in 2017,now i use access 2013 to storage and query data,use python's pandas and openpyxl to analyse data,use excel to show result.
In 2018,i plan to built a  systerm based on flask framework to do my job.
The function of this systerm will contain:
1.Collecte the construction progress and represent in WBS;
2.Calculate the BOQ of contract according to WBS;
3.Calculate the BOQ of sub-contract according to WBS;
4.Calculate the theoretic material consumpton according to WBS;
5.Calculate gross profit;
6.Show the result above in the web;
I will use Mysql and Python in back-end,and finish the back-end code first.Then learn front-end knowledge and flask to do the else.
